# jhscript: haiku-generator
A short script to create a random haiku form a set of haikus. Feel free to add your own locally, or submit a pull request.


Haikus MUST be named haiku <number> and the max number is set in max.txt.
The script will then download all the files form "haiku 1" to "haiku <contents of max.txt>"
  
  
 Saved haikus are saved to haikus/export/<haiku-name>.txt locally.
