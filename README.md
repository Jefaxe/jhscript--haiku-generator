# jhscript: haiku-generator
A short script to create a random haiku form a set of haikus. Feel free to add your own locally, or submit a pull request.


Haikus MUST be named haiku [number] and the max number is set in max.txt.
The script will then download all the files form "haiku 1" to "haiku [contents of max.txt]"
  
  
 Saved haikus are saved to haikus/export/[haiku-name].txt locally.
